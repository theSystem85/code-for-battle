> **Superseded (2026-10-18):** the version is now computed at build time from `package.json` plus `features/unreleased/**` entries, and `npm run release` creates releases. See the "Deployment" and "Versioning and release notes" sections of `AGENTS.md`. The scripts described below were removed.

# Version Management System - Bug Fix

## Problem

The original implementation used a `post-commit` Git hook, which caused **infinite recursion**:

1. User commits → post-commit hook runs
2. Hook bumps version in package.json
3. Hook amends the commit to include package.json
4. Amending triggers another commit
5. Loop repeats infinitely → version went from 0.0.0 to 0.585.0 in 585 iterations!

## Root Cause

- `post-commit` runs **AFTER** the commit is already made
- Modifying files after commit requires `git commit --amend`
- Amending creates a new commit, which triggers the hook again
- Result: **Infinite loop**

## Solution

Changed from `post-commit` to **`prepare-commit-msg`** hook:

### Why prepare-commit-msg?

1. **Runs BEFORE commit is finalized** - still in staging phase
2. **Can modify and stage files** without amending
3. **Single atomic commit** - all changes (code + version) in one commit
4. **No recursion** - hook only runs once per user commit action

### How It Works Now

```
User runs: git commit -m "FEAT: Add new feature"
    ↓
prepare-commit-msg hook triggers
    ↓
Read commit message from $1 parameter
    ↓
Bump version based on message (FEAT → minor bump)
    ↓
Update package.json (0.1.0 → 0.2.0)
    ↓
Regenerate src/version.js
    ↓
Stage both files: git add package.json src/version.js
    ↓
Commit proceeds with all changes included
    ↓
DONE - No recursion!
```

## Key Changes

### 1. Hook Type Change
- ❌ `.git/hooks/post-commit` (REMOVED)
- ✅ `.git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg` (NEW)

### 2. Script Updates

**OLD (buggy):**
```javascript
// Used git log to read last commit (doesn't exist yet!)
const commitMessage = execSync('git log -1 --pretty=%B')
// Then amended commit (causes recursion)
execSync('git commit --amend --no-edit --no-verify')
```

**NEW (fixed):**
```javascript
// Receives commit message as argument
const commitMessage = process.argv[2]
// No git operations needed - files auto-staged by hook script
```

### 3. Version Tracking
- Changed `src/version.js` from gitignored to tracked
- Version changes are now part of the same commit
- Cleaner git history

## Files Changed

1. **Deleted**: `.git/hooks/post-commit`
2. **Created**: `.git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg`
3. **Updated**: `scripts/bump-version.js` - removed git operations
4. **Updated**: `.gitignore` - removed version.js exclusion
5. **Updated**: `VERSION_MANAGEMENT.md` - documentation
6. **Reset**: `package.json` version from 0.585.0 → 0.1.0

## Testing

Current version: **0.1.0**

To test:
```bash
# Make a change
echo "// test" >> some-file.js
git add some-file.js

# Commit with FEAT prefix (should bump minor version)
git commit -m "FEAT: Test version system"

# Check version - should now be 0.2.0
cat package.json | grep version

# Both package.json and version.js should be in this commit
git log -1 --name-only
```

## Why This Works

1. **prepare-commit-msg runs once** per user commit command
2. **Message is available** as a parameter ($1) 
3. **Files can be staged** before commit finalizes
4. **No amendment needed** - everything in one atomic operation
5. **Hook doesn't trigger itself** - it only runs for user-initiated commits

## Prevention Measures

The hook script includes a check:
```sh
if [ -z "$COMMIT_SOURCE" ] || [ "$COMMIT_SOURCE" = "message" ]; then
```

This ensures the hook:
- ✅ Runs for normal commits
- ❌ Skips for merge commits
- ❌ Skips for rebase operations
- ❌ Skips for amendments

## Verification

Version progression will now be clean:
- Start: 0.1.0
- FEAT commit → 0.2.0
- FIX commit → 0.2.1
- IMPROVE commit → 0.3.0
- REFACTOR commit → 0.3.1

**No more infinite loops! 🎉**
