"The user was unsatisfied with the previous F22 airstrip fix. Fix remaining cases where F22 can get stuck during takeoff/landing and block other F22, prevent immediate reland after attack command, enforce attack-until-target-destroyed-or-out-of-ammo/fuel behavior, and increase F22 fuel consumption by 3x with extra 2x during takeoff phase."
