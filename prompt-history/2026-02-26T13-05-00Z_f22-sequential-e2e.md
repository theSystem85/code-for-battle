## Prompt
write an e2e test that tests that verifies the scenario where 3 F22 on an airstrip correctly start one after another and each attack a goup of enemy units and after the destruction of these units automatically return to the airstrip and land ontheir parking spots correctly. The test should not build anything. Everything needed is already there. it is just to verify the starting/attacking/landing/parking works correctly. Also ensure that the refilling of the ammo when parked works as well BUT only when the unit is parked not earlier when still moving on the airstrip.

## Summary of implementation
- Added Playwright E2E test `tests/e2e/f22SequentialAirstripCycle.test.js`.
- Scenario setup uses cheats to spawn one airstrip, 3 parked F22s, and 3 enemy groups.
- Validates strict sequential F22 takeoff ordering and increasing takeoff timestamps.
- Validates all enemy groups are destroyed, then all F22 auto-return, land, and park in occupied slots.
- Adds explicit failure condition if ammo increases while F22 is not parked.
- Confirms ammo refill is observed only after parked settle for each F22.
- Captures and asserts no critical console/page errors.
