## Summary

Implemented the F22 Raptor stealth fighter unit. This is a new air unit that spawns from the Helipad (requires both Helipad and Radar Station) and uses air-to-ground missiles. The F22 is a premium unit costing 5000 and complementing the Apache helicopter with higher speed, greater range, and powerful missile attacks.

- Spawns from Helipad building (requires Helipad + Radar Station in tech tree)
- Air unit with flight mechanics (altitude, landing, refueling/rearming on helipad)
- Fires 6 air-to-ground missiles per sortie
- High speed (9.0) and long range
- Auto-returns to helipad when ammo depleted
- Uses `f22_raptor_map.webp` for map rendering and `f22_raptor_sidebar.webp` for sidebar
