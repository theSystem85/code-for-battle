## Prompt
1) AGF selection works for defence buildings now but artillery and rocket turrets do not fire at selected targets still, they just aim and do nothing! Think harder to fix the issue. Find out why and fix it! Make sure not to break the new queue system for defence buildings and AGF.

2) Also ensure to show the attack cursor when defence buildings are selected and mouse hovers over enemy units.

3) Also ensure when multiple targets are selected (using AGF) that then a red line connects the queued units to attack in its order.
