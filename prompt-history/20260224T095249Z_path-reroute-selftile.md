## Prompt
ensure the path planning and movement algorithm of ground units is ignoring its own occupied tile when doing dodging and re-routing because it currently looks like this could be the reason for the strange inefficient continuous re-routing behaviour of the units! First analyse if this is the case and let me know. If yes then fix it, if not do nothing (do not change any files) and let me just know!
