## Prompt
more issues to fix:
1) the F22 is pushing ground units away! ensure it does not!
2) ensure max ammo of the F22 is just 8 rockets
3) ensure the F22 does not fire more rockets at a target than required to destory it!
4) the takeoff speed of the F22 is way too slow in the beginning
5) after takeoff is finished the F22 just sits in mid air and does NOT approach the actual target: Ensure it does!
6) still all F22 when on the airstrip parked move all at the same time to start point BUT instead they should sit still and wait until start position is clear (queue system!)
