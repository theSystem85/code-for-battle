## Prompt
now here is what works already:
A1-3, C1, E1

and here is what does not:
A4, A7(still too slow at start) + A8(units do not go back to their parking spots), A9(not good), A10, A11(still stuck after takeoff), B3, B4

and here is when not clear because of other issues:
A5, A6, B1, B2, C2, C3(ammo bar does not seem to update), C4

for each of this 3 categories add a specific icon to the spec file's spec that can be changed when spec is done (?, checkmark, red x)
Now update the spec file with current status check from me

## Implementation Notes
- Updated `specs/021-f22-raptor-unit.md` with explicit icon legend (`✅`, `❌`, `?`) and a user validation snapshot dated 2026-02-25.
- Applied user-provided status values directly to each referenced requirement ID (`A1-3`, `A4-11`, `B1-4`, `C1-4`, `E1`).
- Added new unresolved-tracking entry to `TODO/Bugs.md` capturing current not-working and unclear requirement IDs.
