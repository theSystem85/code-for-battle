**LLM**: copilot

## Prompt
update the agents.md to ensure for every bug or feature request that will be implemented there also has to be an e2e test that verifies that the implementation is correct. First implement the feature or bugfix, then in the same go implement the e2e test, run it and improve the code and or test until the e2e test succeeds BUT always ensure that the e2e test is actually meaningful so that the code adjusts to the the test and not vice versa.

## Changes
- Updated `AGENTS.md` with a new mandatory rule requiring a meaningful E2E test for every implemented bugfix/feature.
- Documented the same policy in `specs/027-playwright-e2e-testing.md` under a policy update section.
- Added a completed improvement entry in `TODO/Improvements.md` to track the workflow requirement.
