# 20260224T133211Z — F22 Follow-up Fixes

**LLM**: Copilot  
**UTC Timestamp**: 2026-02-24T13:32:11Z

## Prompt Summary

Address remaining PR feedback for F22:
1. Correct F22 spawn point on airstrip (not center spawn).
2. Fix F22 inability to move/lift off when commanded.
3. Add build-only occupancy tiles and buildable streets.
4. Make airstrip mostly passable except requested occupied sub-rectangle.
5. Ensure F22 build speed scales with Vehicle Factory count.

## Applied Updates

- Added `src/utils/buildingPassability.js` for shared build-only/airstrip passability helpers.
- Updated building placement + validation to support `buildOnlyOccupied`.
- Added street as a buildable type in data + sidebar button and base availability.
- Made streets non-selectable and hidden from building overlay rendering.
- Updated key movement/path/collision checks to treat build-only tiles as passable.
- Added dedicated non-center airstrip spawn points for F22.
- Enabled air-unit movement/attack command handling for F22 (Apache flight pipeline parity).
- Included F22 in `vehicleFactorySpeedUnitTypes` for faster production with multiple Vehicle Factories.
- Added targeted tests for build-only occupation logic and F22 vehicle-factory speed scaling.
