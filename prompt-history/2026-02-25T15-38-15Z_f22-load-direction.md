## Prompt
When a game with parked F22 on airstrip is loaded the F22 are not heading in the same direction as they would spawn. Ensure they do.

## Changes
- `src/saveGame.js`: Added `direction` and `rotation` to the serialized unit data so future saves persist heading
- `src/saveGame.js`: Imported `getBuildingIdentifier` from `./utils.js` and `ensureAirstripOperations` / `getAirstripParkingSpots` from `./utils/airstripUtils.js`
- `src/saveGame.js`: Added post-buildings-load step that re-derives the parked F22 `direction` and `rotation` from the airstrip parking spot facing value — covers both new saves and old saves that didn't persist direction
