## Prompt
when user hovers over HUD and the tooltip is shown then also ensure the actual value of the hovered bar is shown as well in absolute numbers like "fuel 5000m" (as range in meters, 1 tile == 10m) or "ammo 5" (in shots/bullets/rockets not bursts) or "health 30". Ensure to build this feature in a way that it automatically would apply for newly added units and buildings!
