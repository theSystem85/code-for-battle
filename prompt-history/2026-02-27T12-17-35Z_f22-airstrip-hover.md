Prompt:
prevent landed F22 from begin in the air immediately by skipping the start sequence. This happens when landed F22 is commanded to land on the airstrip => it get in the air immediately and lands again. Instead show the movement block cursor when user hovers over the airstrip where the F22 is already landed (but not when user hovers over another airstrip).
