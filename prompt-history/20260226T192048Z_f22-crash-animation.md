## Prompt
Ensure when F22 gets destroyed in air that the jet continues to fly in currently headed direction but slowly goes deeper until hitting the ground (animate a crash) while animating fire and smoke coming out of the engines at the back of the jet and on its wings. Play some crash sound when it hits the ground (see which files are already available in the repo sounds and pick one that suits). Ensure the wreck then spawns where the crash happened!
