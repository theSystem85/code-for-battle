## Prompt
"fix these issues now:
1) when F22 is commanded to move somewhere while still on the airstrip, then it takes off correctly BUT when I command it to attack instead then it does the correct path planning to start place on the strip but it does not move at all and gets stuck on the parking spot.
2) ensure the F22 does automatically attempt to land on the airstrip (or go in the landing queue) when the targer it should attack is destroyed OR it is out of ammo
3) on mobile the F22 does not seem to move/start at all when using tap (instead of click) command. Then I also see no green target position indicator on the map so it might be an event handling issue. Attacking works though but only with AGF on mobile, also not when clicking directly on the target.
4) ensure when F22 in on the starting point of the airstrip while still on the ground (until the point where lift off begins) that there is also an acceleration. Current the F22 just moves there with constant speed but should actually accerlerate. Also the acceration and take off (lift higher) phase after initial lift off should be 2x as long up until the end of the airstrip (right edge of it).

Fix all issues now!"

## Notes
- Patched grounded F22 combat steering conflict that blocked taxi after attack commands.
- Added airborne F22 return-to-airstrip triggers for empty ammo and destroyed combat follow-targets.
- Improved mobile direct enemy tap attack dispatch and F22 altitude-aware hit testing.
- Tuned runway behavior with taxi acceleration ramp and slower/longer post-liftoff strip phase.
