## Prompt Summary
Continue F22 follow-up fixes and resolve remaining issues:
1. F22 must move as airborne unit when in air (no ground pathfinding/obstacle avoidance in air).
2. F22 must use runway lifecycle from parking spawn points to runway start, takeoff roll/liftoff, and reverse on landing.
3. Implement all F22 sounds (`F22Flight`, `F22Landing`, `F22TakeOff_1`, `F22TakeOff_2`).
4. Keep ground pathfinding while F22 is driving/taxiing on the ground.
5. Show `move-into` cursor when F22 is selected and hovering over airstrip.
6. Allow single-click selecting landed F22 above airstrip (unit priority over building hitbox).
7. Remove F22 shadow while driving; show shadow only in air.
8. Keep F22 slow on ground and 2x Apache speed while flying.
9. Set F22 combat range equal to rocket turret range.

## Implementation Notes
- Added dedicated airstrip runway/parking utilities and fixed-wing F22 state machine.
- Reworked F22 spawn/slot/runway integration and command handling.
- Added F22 sound mappings and movement-triggered playback.
- Updated cursor and selection behavior for airstrip interactions.
- Updated specs and TODO tracking.
